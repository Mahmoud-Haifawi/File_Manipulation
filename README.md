# File_Manipulation
We have a dataset with around 500000 words, each with its unique length and meaning. We sought to determine the average word length, the longest and shortest words, and mirrored words (the reversed words will be the same as the original words). When we applied our program without using concurrency and multithreading principles, the program ran slowly and had poor performance; therefore, it was inefficient; however, reapplying our program with threads reduced run time and improved performance, making it easier to maintain and use.
